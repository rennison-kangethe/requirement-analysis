# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction.

This repository serves as the workspace for documenting the requirement-analysis phase in software development.  
It aims to explain what requirement analysis is, why it is important, and how it is carried out in a software project lifecycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
